# DSA in Java — Learning & Progress Tracker 🚀

This repository documents my **structured journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java**, with a clear goal of **mastering problem-solving skills for interviews and real-world applications**.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This repository is a *work in progress*. Not all topics are completed yet.  
> It reflects **active learning, consistent practice, and gradual mastery** rather than a finished course dump.

## 🎯 Objective

- Build **strong fundamentals in DSA**
- Develop **problem-solving and algorithmic thinking**
- Prepare for **technical interviews and placements**
- Achieve **long-term mastery**, not short-term memorization

The learning and problem selection are primarily based on the **Striver / Take U Forward (TUF) DSA Sheet**, which is widely used for structured interview preparation.
